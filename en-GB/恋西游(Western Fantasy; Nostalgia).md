---

月色映拱桥 寒夜钟声敲  
青春往事 随北风绕啊绕

Moonlight casting on bridge, bell tolling at night.  
The past hovering in the north wind.

古老的街道 路的尽头有座庙  
谁许愿太过潦草

In the temple at the end of the ancient street,  
who had made the sloppy wish.

轻狂的年少 嫌江湖渺小  
从不弯腰 路不平就拔刀

The wild teenage looked down upon the world.  
Never bowed down to forces,  
upheld justice throughout the journey.

我们的故事 被吟唱成了传说  
精彩的情节 好多

People are chanting our story as a legend,  
many plots are appealing.

恋西游 我回到小时候  
金箍棒 何时才到手  
牛魔王你别走 别老举拳头  
或许能交个朋友

Nostalgia brings me back to childhood,  
when I hadn't got the gold-banded cudgel.  
Bull Demon King, please stay and put down your fist,  
maybe we could be friends.

恋西游 我回到小时候  
想乘筋斗云去走走  
却最远只到过 榕树下的村口  
离西域 还有多久

Nostalgia brings me back to childhood,  
when I wish to soar on the cloud.  
But the banyan of the village was the farthest I reached.  
How far's left to the West?

听风沙呼啸 驼铃敲古道  
千年孤傲 我跟历史过招

Roaring the sandstorm, tinkling the camel bell.  
Aloof along, I'm challenging in thousand years.

谁又在谁的 章回小说里逍遥  
一路上除魔斩妖

Who's free and unfeltered in serial novels,  
defeating demons and ghosts on the road.

古镇酒旗飘 夕阳挂树梢  
檀香袅绕 说书人响板敲

Banners waving, the sun setting on the tree.  
Incense burning, storyteller banged his block.

我们的故事 被吟唱成了传说  
精彩的情节 好多

People are chanting our story as a legend,  
many plots are appealing.

恋西游 我回到小时候  
金箍棒 何时才到手  
那梦中的朋友 叫做混沌兽  
名字丑 却很温柔

Nostalgia brings me back to childhood,  
when I hadn't got the gold-banded cudgel.  
Appeared in my dream, the Chaotic Monster  
is poorly-named but tender.

恋西游 我回到小时候  
想乘筋斗云去走走  
却最远只到过 榕树下的村口  
离西域 还有多久

Nostalgia brings me back to childhood,  
when I wish to soar on the cloud.  
But the banyan of the village was the farthest I reached.  
How far's left to the West?

↑ A

话要说清楚  
爱了要付出  
我话不多 比较慢熟  
人低调 向往自由

Words ought to be clear,  
love means sincere pay.  
I'm reserved and late-adopted,  
low-key in attitude, longing for freedom.

(Repeat A)

仙人魔 都走走  
听听传说  
三界的故事  
有我

God, human, devil realms  
scattering legends.  
Within the stories,  
I am.
