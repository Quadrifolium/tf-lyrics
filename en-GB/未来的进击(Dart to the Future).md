梦想的约定 未来的进击  
别怀疑 所有秘密都揭开谜底  
青春的剧情 是未知的命运  
逆风不畏惧

The dream we started, dart to the future.  
Don't doubt it, every secret will be brought to light.
The youthful story is the fate unexplored,
we dare to face the wind.

我们来自不同的路径  
却向往同个方向前进  
也许 沿路会充满着危机  
阻挡了光明

We started off from different paths,  
but are striding to the same target.  
Maybe dangers are filled all along the way,  
light's blocked out wholly.

没关系 我们有百分百的勇气  
热情 转身后还会再继续  
下过雨 会看见美丽天晴  
梦 炙热相信

Forget it. We have all our courage mustered up.  
Passion keeps going on in a turnaround.  
Bright sky will emerge after the rain.  
Dream's fervent at heart.

哪怕会遇到更多的危险袭击  
有你坚定的友情不怕暴风雨  
一加一 再加一 燃烧着热情  
一条心 我和你 等于绝不放弃  
结局是精彩可期

Even if we suffered more dangers and attacks,  
with your company, I don't fear violent storms.  
One, and one, and another one, passion's burning.  
You and me are at one, nothing makes us back down.  
The ending's worth expecting.

梦想的约定 未来的进击
别忘记 都值得我们去探寻
跨越轨迹 终汇成了回忆
Dream up! 做我自己

The dream we started, dart to the future.  
Don't lose it, every step deserves exploring.  
Across the past tracks, all those turn to memories.  
Dream up! Be what we are.
