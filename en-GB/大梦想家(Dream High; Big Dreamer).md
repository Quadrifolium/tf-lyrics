一个一个梦飞出了天窗  
一次一次想穿梭旧时光

Dreams fly out of the wide skylight,  
minds travel back to the good old times.

雨再大 也总要回家  
被淋湿的鞋 晒干再出发  
轻松的步伐 被泥土冲刷  
力量无限放大

Though rain pours, I rush back home.  
Dry off the soaked shoes, and set off again.  
Striding footsteps, been washed through,  
we got power in the rain.

我们 被小事打扰  
为心事烦恼 骨骼和时间赛跑  
未来的最佳男主角  
准没准备好

Every day, the trifles trouble, the worries double,  
growing in race with the time  
Actor of the future top level,  
are you in your prime?

A ↓

带着光  
跟我飞翔  
感受风的速度在耳边 呼啸远方

Carrying the light,  
taking a flight,  
to feel the wind blowing, roaring aside.

一个一个梦飞出了天窗  
一次一次想穿梭旧时光  
插上竹蜻蜓张开了翅膀  
飞到任何想要去的地方

Dreams fly out of the wide skylight,  
minds travel back to the good old times.  
Put on bamboo-copter, spread the wings,  
fly to anywhere we haven't seen.

一个一个梦写在日记上  
一点一点靠近诺贝尔奖  
只要你敢想就算没到达理想  
至少有回忆珍藏

Script the dreams as records,  
getting closed to big awards.  
Fly the dream high, even if it fall apart,  
we have memories deep in heart.

↑ B

我们 慢慢地生长  
从小的愿望 到大的梦想起航  
坚持是生命的永恒  
跳动的心脏

We are growing day and night.  
Out of wishes, chasing of big dream starts.  
Insistence is the lasting theme of life,  
the immortal beating heart.

(Repeat A)

(Repeat B)

未来是什么样  
心未眠夜未央  
像钻石一样闪亮

What is tomorrow like?  
I wonder in the night.  
It's a gem shining bright.

站在逆风的方向  
反而更大声地唱  
YOLO青春 就一次疯狂

Event the storm blows,  
cheer louder my solo.  
Be bold, and shout YOLO.

(Repeat B)
