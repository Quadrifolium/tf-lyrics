Yes, I'm in love with you.  
Just listen to my world.  
Yes, I'm in love with you.

> 睡梦中醒来 把眼睛睁开  
崭新的一天 是什么色彩  
Open my heart 充满了期待  
阳光也在对我召唤

Waking up from dream, I open my eyes.  
This brand-new day, what colour it shines?  
Open my heart, expecting new signs,  
I hear the calling from sunshine.

> That's right  
看那窗外天空多么蔚蓝

That's right.  
Outside the window, it's the azure sky.

> 跟我一同寻找 憧憬的未来  
去吹一吹微风 看一看大海  
哼着歌 骑着单车  
一路上 自由自在

Pursuing with me the future longing,  
feeling the light breeze, seeing the wide sea,  
humming and riding a bike,  
I enjoy this easy time.

(Let's gonna fly)

> Yes, I'm in love with you  
I'm so in love with you  
把快乐一点一点装进心里面  
发酵在某年某月某天

Yes, I'm in love with you.  
I'm so in love with you.  
Fill up my heart with every joy we do,  
to ferment all my sentiment through.

(I wanna be with you)

> Yes, I'm in love with you  
I'm so in love with you  
有你在 晴天雨天都值得纪念  
把所有好心情带给你 永远保持新鲜

Yes, I'm in love with you.  
I'm so in love with you.  
You make all sunny, rainy days so true.  
Share my good frame of mind all with you, keep it forever new.

> (That's right)  
全新的体验  
每天每天 这感觉不会变  
我的心跳要让你听得见  
睁开双眼就会有新的发现

(That's right.)  
Standing in new scene,  
day and night fly, the feeling never change.  
I want to make you hear my heartbeat.  
Open your eyes, you'll extend your vision range.

> 我看见你的画面  
用我的相机轻轻地拍下  
你每一张微笑的脸  
(That's right)  
印在我的脑海 永远不变

Your figure, I clearly see.  
Use my camera to take your photos,  
your smiling face is appealing.  
(That's right.)  
Imprint it in my mind, keep it unchanged.

(Repeat A)

> 青春像糖果 甜甜的味道  
(Fall in love)  
嘭嘭嘭心跳 你能否听到  
(Fall in love)  
要一起说说笑笑  
要一起热热闹闹  
Follow me 未来一同揭晓

Youth is like candy, it has so much sweet.  
(Fall in love.)  
My throbbing heartbeat, oh can you hear it?  
(Fall in love.)  
Together, we talk and laugh.  
Together, we play and chaff.  
Follow me, the future, we are ready to see.

(Repeat A)

(Fall in love with you)  
I'm in love with you  
(Fall in love with you)  
I'm in love with you  
I love you
