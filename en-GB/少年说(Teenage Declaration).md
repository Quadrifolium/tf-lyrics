天窗外那树影被拉很长  
透射出若隐若现的微光  
伸出手 嘴角上扬  
我就能触及心中的希望  
Outside, the tree shadows are strengthened long.  
The sunlight glimmers through the leaves along.  
Hands stretch out, smiles start,  
  I touch clearly the hope in the heart.

午后跑道旁弥漫青草香  
延伸向名为未来的方向  
放学后篮球场上  
听信仰疯狂 在血液中流淌  
Fragrance of grass permeates where we run,  
  lanes extend to direction of future.  
Running on court after school,  
  the faith's surging, flowing in my blood.
A ↓

就算退缩懦弱  
也不会有被同情的目光  
不如即刻整装  
勇敢冲向梦想的彼方  
Yielding and cowardice  
  never get sympathy, never bring light.  
Why not get ready to start,  
  to dash forward to the dream afar.

我微笑歌唱 心底的愿望  
很简单 只要你坚强  
我们挺起胸膛 去乘风破浪  
让世界东方迸射出光芒  
I sing with smile, the wish deep in mind  
  is simple only if you stay.  
Raise high the head, brave winds and waves,  
  lighten the orient bright with dazzling rays.

我微笑歌唱 心底的梦想  
等待它华丽地绽放  
记忆在远方 不朽地荡漾  
我们一起把迷茫的前方都照亮  
I sing with smile the dream deep in mind.  
I'm waiting for the bloom some day.  
Memories of past are rippling far behind.  
We kindle the road ahead and we break up haze away.

↑ B

看楼外那蒲公英在生长  
跟微风轻轻在空中飘荡  
即使不能够远航  
但也要飞往最憧憬的地方  
Dandelions growing outside the building  
  have parachutes floating in the air.  
Even if the wind's unfeeling,  
  be bold to fly to the place they once aimed at.

(Repeat A)

(Repeat B)

我追寻最初的冲动  
踏坚定的征程  
中国的梦  
有最耀眼天空  
Following the initial theme,  
  taking the journey high,  
  our Chinese dream  
  will flare in the sky.
