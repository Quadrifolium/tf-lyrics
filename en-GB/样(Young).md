蜿蜒的 沿途一路曲折  
有时候相信的 未必开花结果  
小路旁 堆积太多叶落  
风吹动你和我 剩下沙丘荒漠

Meandering path winding all along,  
sometimes what I believe never blossoms or ripe.  
Fallen leaves clumping on paving stones,  
Breeze wafting you and me, leaving desert alone.

小声地 唱着我们的歌  
歌词像本小说 渺小到失措  
不惆怅 依旧安然无恙  
依旧人来人往 上台又散场

Humming that rhythm of our song,  
in the narrative plot, we're tiny and lost.  
Don't be grief, it's the same as before --  
they come and go away, we play and leave stage.

A ↓

我怎么变这样  
变得这样倔强  
每一步的地方  
每一站都不会忘

Am I still living young?  
I'm now becoming clung.  
Engraving all my steps,  
reviving all the past reps.

舞台上远远的光  
落在我的肩膀  
想起第一次那个模样

Shedding on shoulders,  
blazing limelight from afar,  
reminiscing our first step to depart.

B ↓

我怎么变这样  
变得这样疯狂  
用这灿烂时光  
绽放不一样的光

Am I still living young?  
I make myself flung.  
Taking the brilliant days,  
to blaze my own rays.

就算黑夜太漫长  
风景全被遮挡  
抬头就有一片星光

Long-last the endless dark may,  
all rewards were they to shade,  
stars are always shining overhead.

旋转着 故事里的风车  
谁总任性的说 有太多困惑  
老地方 依旧安然无恙  
依旧人来人往 像从前一样

Whirling swift the pinwheel in the tale.  
Who's always complaining, the life's confusing.  
In the old place, things remain all the same,  
they come and go away, we play and leave stage.

(Repeat A)

季节一次一次更迭过往  
也在一步一步实现愿望  
我要让全世界记住  
我的模样

Shifting seasons take all the past away,  
Steady steps take to get the hope drawn,  
I want people all around to say  
I am living young.

(Repeat B)

我怎么会变成这样

What makes me stubbornly living young?
