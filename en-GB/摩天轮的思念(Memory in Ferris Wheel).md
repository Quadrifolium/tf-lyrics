摩天轮之上 回忆正旋转着过往  
也许这是我 最后一次和你眺望  
你选的地方 爱与伤复杂的景象  
开始和结束都一样

In the Ferris wheel, the past memory is rotating.  
This may be the last time I clap my eyes on you.  
Along the way you choose, love and sorrow are entangled.  
The end is like how it started.

A ↓

偶尔也听说 除了我 你还有个角落  
我却装作沉默 还冷漠地犯错  
让你找他诉说

I have heard you open your heart to another one.  
But I remain silent, keep blundering with indifference.  
It pushes you closer to him.

↑ A

B ↓

我想我还在等 等你说早已不可能  
星空下的眼泪 再也忍不住崩溃  
霓虹灯绕一圈 我们就要分别  
我给的爱停在 门一开的瞬间

I am still waiting for you to say it's all over.  
Let the tears burst out under the starry night.  
When the neon finishes the circle, we will be separated.  
My love termintes at the moment the door opens.

↑ B

摩天轮之上 回忆正旋转着过往  
开始和结束都一样

In the Ferris wheel, the past memory is rotating.  
The end is like how it started.

(Repeat A)

(Repeat B)

(Repeat B)

多希望能倒转 摩天轮的思念

How I wish to reverse the memory in Ferris wheel.
