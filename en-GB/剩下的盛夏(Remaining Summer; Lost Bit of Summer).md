# 剩下的盛夏<br />Remaining Summer (Lost Bit of Summer)

**(DRAFT)**

Composed by Jay Chou(周杰伦)
Lyrics by HUANG Jun-lang(黄俊郎)

---

蝉鸣是窗外渐渐倒数的钟声  
考卷的分数是往上爬的树藤  
我画在你手掌上的蝴蝶 飞走了吗

The song of cicadas counts the remaining days,  
the scores on papers marks the efforts paid.  
The butterfly I stroke on your palm,  
has it flown away?

白云是蓝天正在放的风筝  
青春是操场奔跑的我们  
不要担心受伤 勇敢地朝梦想 闯一闯

Clouds are kites flying in the blue sky,  
our youth is running in the schoolyard.  
Hurts never scare us,  
on the road to the dream, be brave to fly.

还记得 我在等你下课 想送你的鲜花我手拿著  
经过的同学大家都笑著 因为花新鲜到蜜蜂都还停留着

On that day, I waited for you,  
with flowers in my hands.  
Schoolmates passed and grinned,  
because the bees found this treasured land.

被叮了 你笑了 尴尬了 你的脸红了

I'm stung.  
You smiled.  
It's awkward.  
You turned blushed.

枫下的秋千 盛夏的暗恋 我们说过要永远 在对方身边  
走廊的光线 剪影的校园 即将是从前

The swing under the maple leaves the crush in this summer,  
we've promised to be together forever.  
The beam on the corridor, the silhouette of the campus,  
will be the days before.

毕业的那天 剩下的时间 能不能别轻易 就说了再见  
快门按下 手牵著手 暂停童年

On the leaving day, in the remaining time,  
the sound of "goodbye", can you not say?  
Press the shutter, hold your hand,  
to freeze the day.

剩下的盛夏 被叮了 剩下的盛夏 你笑了  
剩下的盛夏 尴尬了 你的脸红了 我的脸肿了

In this summer, I'm stung.  
In this summer, you smiled.  
In this summer, it's awkward.  
You turned blushed, I got swelled.

剩下的盛夏 被叮了 剩下的盛夏 你笑了  
剩下的盛夏 尴尬了

In this summer, I'm stung.  
In this summer, you smiled.  
In this summer, it's awkward.

(Repeat)
