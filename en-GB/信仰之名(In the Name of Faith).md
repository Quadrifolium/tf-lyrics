我向命运拒绝  
在黑暗之中被湮灭  
将荒芜都溶解  
亲手终结深渊的界限

I strive with the fate,  
refuse to be buried in the dark.  
I will break the desolate,  
conquer the abyss with an ending mark.

用生命为祭献  
这绝不妥协的信念  
心底的梦终会临现这世界

I will never compromise  
with my life's every part.  
It will finally realize  
that dream in my heart.

厄运梦魇在不断循环的更替  
真理早已被肆意的掩盖痕迹  
双眸却依旧闪烁明晰坚毅  
仍旧固执的追寻

Dooms fall in the day and mares come at night,  
the truth had long been covered.  
My eyes are still firm and bright,  
keep chasing the dream forward.

次元中遍地麻木渲染的死寂  
谁又被枷锁剥夺幻想的权利  
任遍布的黑夜吞没了身躯  
也要创造破晓的光明

The earth is soiled with numb and no mercy,  
people have been deprived of imagination.  
Though the darkness may swallow my body,  
I will catch the illumination.

被殒灭的文明  
心中的希冀  
是否尚有一丝存寄  
我拼尽全力  
却只为换取  
一个不确定的奇迹

In this raging ocean,  
is the ark of your hope still unsinkable?  
I endeavour with thorough devotion  
to win a slim miracle.

以信仰为契约  
任虚伪和利益重叠  
这光芒为利剑  
指向依稀可见的终点

In the name of faith,  
fear no selfish and cold-hearted.  
I hold the dazzling sword,  
point to the faraway target.

已降临的明天  
划破无边际的黑夜  
一瞬间将迷惘的时代迸裂

The future is near,  
the dawn is breaking the dark.  
The light will tear  
the lost of the time apart.

轮回下的誓言  
十年间交错的视线  
这羁绊的热切  
熔化时空法则的锁链

The oath beyond lives,  
the firm eyes we have in a decade,  
with the fused passion,  
we can melt all the chains ever made.

回忆化作勇气  
静静在脑海中浮现  
心底的梦总有一天让全世界听见

Memory shapes no fear,  
all the past raises in my mind.  
The entire world will hear  
the voice once in my heart.

(Repeat A)

跟信仰契合的热血  
已无法冻结和停歇  
生命的诗篇不断转动翻阅  
写下最华丽的章节

My faith blended in blood is flowing,  
nothing can make them departed.  
The book of my life goes on composing,  
with glorious figures charted.

(Repeat B)
