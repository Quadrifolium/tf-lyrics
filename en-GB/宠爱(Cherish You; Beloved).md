小小的年纪还不懂什么是爱  
却被你甜甜的笑容打败  
你眨着大大的眼睛那么可爱  
说话的手往哪儿摆

Though untimely for me to know what love is,  
I'm intoxicated by your smile  
So adorable your bright eyes blinking in peace,  
and your arms waving in your style

每一天上课下课都会有你的陪伴  
每一秒内容我都很喜欢  
解不开的几何图案和你红的脸  
到底有多少个答案

I like every second in school playing or reading poetry,  
because you are always somewhere nearby  
I wonder how to solve that geometry,  
and why you have your face turned shy

A->

我只想给你给你宠爱  
这算不算不算爱  
我还还还搞不明白

I want to give you my cherishing  
Does it shows I'm in love  
Can't find a way to shape it

快乐的事想跟你分享  
难过想给你肩膀  
第一次为一个人紧张

I wish to make you happy, pleasant  
Delight you when you feel down  
Cannot let you go from the present

我好想对你对你宠爱  
才短短几个礼拜  
心情坏因为你不在

How I wish to be with cherished you  
I feel upset without you  
for only a week or two

有一道光  
暖暖地洒下来  
忍不住的小期待  
因为爱

There warmly shines  
a beam of mild light  
I clearly catch the sight  
This is love

<-A

小小的年纪还不懂什么是爱  
却被你甜甜的笑容打败  
你眨着大大的眼睛那么可爱  
好想把你装进口袋

Though untimely for me to know what love is,  
I'm intoxicated by your smile  
So adorable your bright eyes blinking in peace,  
that I wish to hide in my file

其实我有一个好的想法准备打算  
留到十年以后再跟你说  
给你买最大的房子 最酷的汽车  
走遍世界每个角落

I have a perfect plan about you yet I haven't shown,  
which I want to tell you when I'm grown --  
To buy the largest house, the smartest cars,  
to see places and bazaars

我们再来一遍

One more time

(Repeat A)

就这样看着你  
脸红红地呼吸  
在我们的心里  
你就是我的迪斯尼

You are like fine art,  
your dainty face and breath  
Deep in our heart,  
you are the Disney Princess

One Two Three Go!

这不只是我的show  
你不要走  
等一等候  
等我能牵你的手

This is not a one-man show,  
we need you  
Please behold  
One day I will get to you

究竟是不是爱  
到底是不是爱  
我石头木头馒头葱头脑袋不够

Is it love?  
Can it be love?  
My block head, logger head, hammer head  
can't get

我想这就是爱  
明明这就是爱  
我听你 看你 想你 要你开心没够

I think it is love  
I believe in this love  
I see you, hear you, miss you,  
all of these words are true

(Repeat A)

(Repeat A)
